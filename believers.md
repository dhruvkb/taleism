# Believers

> It is time, and now my oath begins.<br>
It shall not end until my death or until my mood changes.<br>
I shall take as many wives as is ethical under both my current religion or the religion of my parents and the penal code of my country, hold as much land as I can afford and father as many children as my spouse consents to.<br>
I shall wear no crowns apart from those conferred upon me by the Lord and win no glory other than repeated success in the Summer of Haskell.<br>
I shall live and die under the guiding light of the Lord.<br>
I am the _monad_ in a functional language.<br>
I am the _view_ in the model-template-view pattern.<br>
I am the _obscurity_ in which languish the hordes of functional languages discarded by mere mortals.<br>
I pledge my life and honor to _Sri Sri Parampujya Mahatma Pranjal Tale Ji_, from this instant and the continuum of all instants to come.

If you have accepted the one true Lord into your heart with sincerity, recite the oath, trying with all your might to maintain a straight face, and then send in a _pull request_ with your name at the bottom and rest assured, it will be merged (unless your name is or contains a profanity in which case it shall be swiftly deleted).
